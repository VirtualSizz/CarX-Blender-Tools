This is an updated version of an addon based on [Blender CarX Mod Tools](https://github.com/Zi9/Blender-CarX-Mod-Tools)

It generates an additional panel within the right toolbox (toggle with 'N') containing buttons for effortless material adjustment and placeholder creation.


## Installation

To begin, please follow these steps:

1. Start by downloading the most recent version of the addon from the "[Releases](https://github.com/VirtualSizz/CarX-Blender-Tools/releases)" section.

2. Next, launch Blender and navigate to the "Edit" menu, then select "Preferences..."

3. Inside the preferences window, find the "Add-ons" tab.

4. Within this tab, you'll see an "Install" button. Click on it and choose the zip file you just downloaded.
